# Effective Scala Example Project

## Overview

This project contains the backend for the ES week 3 project. This demonstrates the complete working system. Students will be given portions of this and have to complete it.


## Running the Project

`sbt run` and visit `http://localhost:3000/`. You should be presented with a UI for a simple todo app.


## Student Tasks

See `QUESTIONS.md` for the student's tasks.


## UI

The UI is implemented in React with Slinky. It's in a separate project so as to not confuse students with Scala 2.13 code.
